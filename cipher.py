programming assignment is my own work and I have not provided this code to
any other student.

I have read and understand the course syllabus's guidelines regarding Academic
Integrity. I understand that if I violate the Academic Integrity policy (e.g.
copy code from someone else, have the code generated by an LLM, or give my
